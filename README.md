## [Chasing game](chasing_game.py)

3 ants are initially placed at the vertices of an isosceles triangle.
Then they all begin to move with velocity of constant modulus and pointing moment by moment
toward the position of the nearest ant in a counterclockwise direction as if chasing it, continuing until they are all at the center of the polygon.
